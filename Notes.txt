1.CDN is a place where react or any library is hosted. so we fetch the hosted library and load in our code by script tag
2. creating elemet is from react while creating root id from react dom
3. most costly thing in UI is when you are changing a dom tree/ dom manipulation
4. ReactElement is nothing but an object which browser understands

const parent = React.createElement("div", 
{id: "parent"},
[
React.createElement("div", 
{id: "child"}, 
[React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am an h1 tag"),
React.createElement("h2", {}, "I am an h2 tag"),
]),
React.createElement("div", 
{id: "child2"}, 
[React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am an h1 tag"),
React.createElement("h2", {}, "I am an h2 tag"),
]),]
)

this how the code will look like if we don't use jsx
5. Whatever is there in root already it'll be replaced by root.render in react.
6. We can render react to even a small portion of code. We don't have to apply to whole application
7. ReactDOM.createRoot is responsible for assigning a root for react rendering code
